* Thu Jun 06 2013 David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> - 0.1.0-1
- Introduce git pkg syntax and use rpm/ as the location of packaging
  Massive simplification to workflow
  Based on an approach from:
    https://github.com/cypher/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/git-new-workdir
  Remove switching between src and packaging

- Store old value of tags in case they were moved and not just made
- Fixup changelog dates

* Wed May 22 2013 David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> - 0.0.8-1
- Handle %setup lines correctly - thanks to Juha for help getting it right
- Clean up comments for patches by removing leading numerics
- Remove whitespace, not just spaces from Version/Release
- Fix missing day-of-month in .changes entry
- Many changes thanks to Marko Saukko:
 - Only require 3 parameters in _src
 - When basetag is not defined use the Version from .spec file if possible.
 - Add -V verbose options and make things less verbose by default.
 - Fix version in changelog when no --ver is given to gp_release.
 - Make sure git interprets the tags as tags and not paths.
 - Check that spec file exists as well.
 - Don't print usage as it makes it very hard to see what actual error is.
 - Print ERROR when error happens.
 - When git tree is empty then we need additional checks.

* Mon Apr 15 2013 David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> - 0.0.7-1
- Force upack to be pristine tar
- Document the --pristine flag

* Thu Apr 11 2013 David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> - 0.0.6-1
- Improve error reports and allow usage() from fatal
- Improve comments and docs
- Don't create mer-master if no patches exist
- Abort if --edit message is not changed
- Look for correct #### when stripping comments
- check EDITOR
- Set GIT_NAME/EMAIL environment variables from config for use in scripts
- Add a --build flag so gp_mkpkg just creates patches/tarball without hacking the spec/yaml

* Sat Mar 30 2013 David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> - 0.0.5-1
- Handle %setup more reliably
- gitpkg service handler validates inputs against regexp

* Sat Mar 30 2013 David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> - 0.0.4-1
- Use gitpkg and verify REPO format

* Fri Mar 29 2013 David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> - 0.0.3-2
- Set noarch, python-yaml dependency and python macros

* Fri Mar 29 2013 David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> - 0.0.3-1
- Change use of --ver, --rel and --base to be more self-explanatory. Reword docs.
- Get the Name from packaging and rename function
- Always add -n src/ even if not present in original %setup
- Fix breakage in gp_release --base (now --ver) handling

* Sun Mar 24 2013 David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> - 0.0.2-1
- Extensive changes: see README.rst
- Patch and branch formats defined more rigidly
- Added source service for OBS
- Merged contributions from Thomas Perl and Kalle Jokiniemi
- Make supports proper packaging
- gp_mkpkg now handles patches in spec and yaml nicely;
  supports --git-dir to allow running in an osc dir
- gp_setup improved to handle more cases using existing
  packaging
- gp_release usefully updates packaging for single patches
  or when a new upstream is released; also useful to make a
  temporary packaging set for trial builds using format:
  Release: <rel>.<gitcount>.<sha1> 
- Lots of "do the right thing"; eg get Version/Release from
  packaging; compare tag to Version; auto-increment Release
- Overview documentation should be clearer

* Mon Sep 10 2012 David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> - 0.0.1-1
- Initial packaging for 0.0.1
